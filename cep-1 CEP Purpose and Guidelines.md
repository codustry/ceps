# What is a CEP?
CEP stands for Codustry Enhancement Proposal. A CEP is a design document providing information to the Codustry community, or describing a new feature for Codustry or its processes or environment.  The CEP should provide a concise practical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

All design authority ultimately derive from Nutchanon Ninyawee, a co-founder of the Codustry company.
