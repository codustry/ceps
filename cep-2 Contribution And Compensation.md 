# Rationale
I want to see codustry have a fair compensation for their contribution. People might go in and out, but
the shares should be the shadow of effect of contribution dynamically, accurately. We should free the share of contribution that 
is not benefit the whole anymore to the common pool. We will together try the best to measurement contributions.

The share could belong to company-wide or project-based.

# Tiers of Shares
1. Lifetime Shares - The share that last a lifetime of the first holder. Usually give to the initciators or great contributors
2. Milestone Shares - The share that give to the group of innovator who success a meaningful milestone. split by a leader and expire in 10 years or an innovation cycle.
