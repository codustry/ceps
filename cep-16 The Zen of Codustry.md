# The Zen of Codustry 

No job is better than dirty job.

Public contribution is better than private contribution.

Transparent is better than privacy.

Gradient is better than binary.

Systematic solution is better than linear solution.

User's end goals is better than user's requirements. 

The best default should always pair with great alternatives.

Keep in mind, true freedom is not the freedom choose.

But, the power to create new choice.

User Success is the king. 

Maintainability is the queen.

Security is the jack. 

We are like the Avengers, of digital world.

We are a group of diverse talents and backgrounds.

Individual must be selected/unselected because of his/her karma solely.

Not race, sex, and other non-senses.

Use longitude to adjust wake up time. 

Use latitude to customize climate.

Anyway mission come first.

Automation is the ace. Letâ€™s do more of this.

Data & Legal is the jokers. Always pay respect.

> Inspired by the zen of python.
