# The Zen of Codustry 

No job is better than dirty job.

Public contribute is better than private contribute.

Transparent is better than privacy.

Systematic solution is better than linear solution.

User's wish is the new king. 

Digital wellbeings, UX/UI are his sons.

Maintainability is the queen. 

CI/CD, docs are some of her daughters.

Security is the jack. 

Communication is a dark art of success. 

Use longitude to adjust wake up time. 

Use latitude to customize climate.

Anyway mission come first.

Cloud services and infrastructures beats bare metal servers.

Although the swarm of IoT/Edge devices should never be ignored. 

Automation is the ace. Letâ€™s do more of this.

Data & Legal is the jokers. Always pay respect.
